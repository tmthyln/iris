# Iris - an attempt to create an RSS aggregator

Due to the decommissioning of Google Podcasts in April 2024,
this is my attempt to create a replacement podcast aggregator.
While I'm at it, I might as well try to make a full RSS reader
(including blog posts that I usually follow via Feedly).

```shell
npx wrangler pages dev --d1 DB=<database-id> -- npm run dev
```
